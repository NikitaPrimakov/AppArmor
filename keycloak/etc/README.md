# Keycloak

To install Keycloak, you can use the following resource - [install keycloak](https://green.cloud/docs/how-to-install-configure-keycloak-on-ubuntu-20-04/)

After that, you can configure the AppArmor profile, as it was done for NGINX

The AppArmor profile for keycloak is located [here](https://github.com/NikitaPrimakov/AppArmor/tree/main/keycloak).
